# fun-with-anagram
Two strings are anagrams if they are permutations of each other. In other words, both strings have same
size and the same characters. Fo example, "aaagmnrs" is anagrams of "anagrams". Given an array of strings,
remove each string that is an anagram of earlier string,then return the remaining array in sorted order.
input = ['code','doce','ecod','framer','frame']
output=['code','frame','farmer']
